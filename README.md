# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 The Dilemma

As built-up areas increase in population density, space becomes an ever increasingly coveted resource. This holds even truer for space suitable for storing and parking vehicles. The congestion and clutter created by the storage of vehicles can throttle streets and push parking prices to soaring heights. 

This image is in stark contrast to the reality that many personal spaces are left empty for much of the day as people go to work, school, etc. By trying to connect these vacant spaces with those who need them, an idea is born.

In these early stages, this concept applies to a broad and diverse amalgamation of demographics including: 

* Daily commuters looking for cheap parking near their place of employment,

* Motorcycle enthusiasts without secure storage for their weekend ride, or 

* Avid fishermen lacking room for a boat in their driveway.

Current solutions to these examples range from poorly implemented to very costly. 

## 1.2 The Project

This project proposes an application operating in the social and mobile computing space to connect users with available storage space with those looking for specific parking solutions. Named Parkit, the application will draw inspiration from existing resource sharing mediums such as AirBnB ([www.airbnb.com](www.airbnb.com)).

Parkit will be a mobile and web application that helps users find a spare park whilst also allowing owners to turn their unused parking space into an additional source of revenue. This will be a win for all whilst also reducing parking pressure in cities. 

# 2. Concept

## 2.1 Idea, Rationale, and Audience

Parkit aims to ease the issues faced by those who require storage solutions for their vehicles by providing cheaper, crowd-sourced alternatives to parking in the city. 

As previously stated, this concept draws inspiration from other resource sharing environments. These applications incentivise users by offering a service to one side of the connection and a revenue stream to those offering it. This particular connection draws from two, distinct, target audiences:

* City inhabitants with spare parking space, and

* Vehicle owners searching for parking alternatives.

## 2.2 Project Aims and Differentiation

Whilst applications such as [Kerb](https://kerb.works/australia/brisbane) already exist, many fail to incorporate features found in other resource sharing applications. These features include:

* Discounted rates to reward long term contracts,

* Parking solutions filtered by appropriate vehicle use e.g. motorcycles, boats, etc., and

* Searching based on current location i.e. ‘find spaces near me’ or ‘find spaces near a destination.’

## 2.3 Social and Mobile Theory

Place & Space:

Within the Parkit application, we understand individuals frustrations when trying to find a carpark in congested areas of the city. Within this application we stressed importance on understanding the context of individuals behaviour and create a source of resolution. 

Tangibility & Awareness:

For this application, the team wanted to create awareness and tangibility for individuals who may lack digital information about this particular problem space. 

Coordination:

The Parkit application allows individuals to coordinate their available space that they have for people to use. Without this use of this application, the information would not be exposed to the public making it unutilised. 

Awareness

The Parkit application will generate awareness for available space areas of use to the consumer. This awareness with display a source of digital information to the consumer by visually showing them graphically what space is free within their vicinity.  

Privacy/Security

Privacy and security concerns are minimal for the Parkit application, however should still be considered.  Chiefly, if payment is to be handled by the application it is crucial that the process is secure.  The users of of the application also have an expectation of privacy - the app must provide enough information between the two parties so that the transaction can occur while also protecting the identity and privacy of the users.

Timetabling

By implementing features such as the long term discount, Parkit encourages users to form an ongoing contract.  This is both more convenient for the users while also providing tangible benefit in the form of a monetary discount for the parker, and regular space occupation by the carpark owner.

# 3. Team

## 3.1 Team Members

* Freya Rogers (DECO3500),

* Samuel Russ (DECO3500),

* Alexander Sarafian (DECO3500),

* Rory Smith (DECO3500), and

* Jarrod Stone (DECO3500).

## 3.2 Responsibilities

In terms of team responsibilities, each team member will be assigned a particular role that they will be in charge of through the entirety of the project. Although these roles are quite specific each team member will make an effort to help the other team members if need be. Team cohesion and prosperity will be ensured through constant communication between team members with each member assisting in any task necessary. 

## 3.3 Key Roles

Team Dominators comprises of the following roles: 

Design		Freya Rogers and Samuel Russ.

Content	Alexander Sarafian.

Front End	Jarrod Stone and Samuel Russ.

Back End	Rory Smith.

## 3.4 Decision Making

Decisions will be made first by deferring to the member of the team whose role most directly relates to the decision being made. However, if another member doesn’t agree with this decision then the group will have an open discussion to determine what is the best choice. 

If no unanimously agreed upon position can be reached then it will be taken to a vote. In the case of a vote there should be no ties as we have a group of five people so no tie-breaking protocol is needed.

## 3.5 Conflict Resolution

The team will handle poor performance or conflict by holding a team meeting and discussing the problem with the offending member. If the member is struggling to complete a certain task we will try to assist them in being able to complete it. 

Similarly, if a member is causing conflict within the group we will also try to address this within a group meeting. However, if the offending member continues to not contribute anything of merit to the assignment or cause conflict within the group then mediation with the course staff will be sought.  

# 4. Communication

## 4.1 Meetings and Communication

A Facebook group will be used as the main communication tool throughout the project. Facebook has largely been chosen because of the fact that all members of the group are already signed up to it and check their notifications on a very frequent basis. This ensures that all group members will be able respond to posts by other members in a timely manner.

The group will meet weekly during workshops as well as whenever deemed necessary to complete upcoming deadlines. If this is needed, it will be determined over the Facebook group.

## 4.2 File Storage

Google Docs will be used for collaborating on files as it is one of the best online text editors, all members have prior experience using it and, most importantly, it allows members to work on the document at the same time and see changes in real time.

This last reason makes it far more suitable for collaborating than sharing a document in a GitHub repository as all members will always be working on the  most up to date version of the document. 

Google Drive will be used for file storage and sharing as it integrates with Google Docs nicely as well as Balsamiq and numerous other Add-ons. GitHub will still be used to submit documents as  per the assessment criteria.

File Naming Conventions will be used to track and uniquely identify any files that are created for the project.

The following naming conventions will be applied to each file:

* Each file name will be displayed in camel case, where the first letter of each work is capitalised i.e. FileName.doc

* An "_" will replace a space i.e. DECO3500_Project.doc

* Each file will be placed within a unique format to identify the file accurately i.e. T3_ProjectProposal.doc

# 5. Plan
